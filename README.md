# Letter counter

This simple program tells the user which is the most frequent vowel, consonant and letter overall. It also tells it how many times said letter is present
in the text.

Either input a text as a parameter in the terminal, or call the program using a local file. Both methods work. It also throws errors if it detects a 
malformed parameter list or can't open the file.
